## Schmenu at a Glance

Schemu is a full stack application dedicated to finding the highest rated food you crave! Do a search for steak, and you'll get results of all the restaurants serving steaks in the area, with ratings and reviews on each individual item. No more looking through a bunch of ratings of restaurants and not being sure if they have the one item that you need to satisfy your craving. No more going to a restaurant with high ratings, and ordering that one food item that's not made as well. No more worrying about the quality of service, because you're going for the specific food item!

The application is made with a React frontend, and the backend is an Express server with a Sequelize database.

**Key Features**

- Browse through all restaurants to check the ratings for every menu item
- Search for any specific food item to find the restaurant that offers the best item in your area
- Favorite a food item at any restaurant so you can easily find the ones you've tried and love
- Add a rating and a review to let people know if they should try this menu item!
